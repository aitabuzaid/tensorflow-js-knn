    <h1>Train a Machine Learning Model with TensorFlow.js and a Webcam!</h1>
    <p>Try locating different objects in front of the webcam, for example,
       a face, a cat, a pencil, etc. Whenever an object is in view, click
       on one of the buttons to add it to its class. Take multiple images
       of each class, by rotation or translation, to improve the model accuracy.
       Add the first object to class A, the second object to class B, and the
       third to class C. Once you are satisfied with the training, use the
       model to predict the class of each object. If you would like to start over,
       click on the Reset button.</p>
